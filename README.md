Hi y'all 👋 

I'm Simme, a developer advocate and open-source contributor from Norrköping, Sweden. I mainly do work in the 🐹&nbsp; golang, 🧑&nbsp; kubernetes, 🐳&nbsp; docker and 🚨&nbsp; site-reliability engineering space. Every now and then I also [speak at conferences and meetups on these topics](https://simme.dev/speaking/).

I maintain and develop a bunch of OSS projects, like 🗼 `containrrr/watchtower`, 😱&nbsp; `containrrr/shoutrrr`, 🤖&nbsp; `k6io/operator`, 💣&nbsp; `k6io/xk6-chaos`, 
and 🎓&nbsp; `simskij/awesome-software-architecture`. Additionally, I'm a [Docker Captain](https://www.docker.com/captains/simon-arronson), the organizer of [GDG East Sweden](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-East-Sweden/) and [Ministry of Testing Stockholm](https://www.meetup.com/Ministry-of-Testing-Stockholm/), as well as a moderator of the `#performance` and `#testing` tags on [dev.to](https://dev.to).

If you want to support my non-k6-related work, have a look at [my sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/simskij/). ❤️
