Hi y'all 👋 

I'm Simme, an engineering manager and open-source contributor from Norrköping, Sweden. I mainly do work in the 🐹&nbsp; golang, 🐍&nbsp; python, ☸️&nbsp; kubernetes, 🐳&nbsp; docker and 🚨&nbsp; site-reliability engineering space. Every now and then I also [speak at conferences and meetups on these topics](https://simme.dev/speaking/).

I maintain and develop a bunch of OSS projects, like 🗼 `containrrr/watchtower`, 😱&nbsp; `containrrr/shoutrrr`, and 🎓&nbsp; `simskij/awesome-software-architecture`. Additionally, I'm a [Docker Captain](https://www.docker.com/captains/simon-aronsson), a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-simon-aronsson) in the cloud category, as well as a moderator of the `#performance` and `#testing` tags on [dev.to](https://dev.to).
